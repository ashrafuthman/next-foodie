# Fix for `__tests__/share.test.tsx` Failing Test

## Issue Description

The test file `__tests__/share.test.tsx` was failing with the error:

```
ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined
```

This error occurs because the test environment (Node.js) doesn't have the `TextEncoder` class available by default, which is typically available in modern browsers.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the code, I found that the issue was related to the following:

1. The `MealsSharePage` component uses the `shareMealHandler` function from `lib/actions.ts`
2. The `shareMealHandler` function processes form data and calls the `saveMeal` function from `lib/meals.ts`
3. The `saveMeal` function treats the image as a `File` object and calls methods like `arrayBuffer()` on it
4. These operations might be using `TextEncoder` internally, or the test environment might not be properly mocking the `File` object and its methods

## Solution

I implemented a two-part solution:

### 1. Add TextEncoder Polyfill

Added a polyfill for `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` in the Jest setup file (`jest.setup.js`):

```javascript
// Polyfill for TextEncoder which is not available in Node.js environment by default
if (typeof global.TextEncoder === 'undefined') {
  const { TextEncoder, TextDecoder } = require('util');
  global.TextEncoder = TextEncoder;
  global.TextDecoder = TextDecoder;
}
```

This provides the `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` classes in the Node.js environment used by Jest.

### 2. Mock Server Components and FormData

After adding the polyfill, a new error appeared:

```
ReferenceError: Request is not defined
```

This error was coming from the Next.js server components, specifically when trying to use `FormData` in the server component. To fix this, I added mocks for the server action and the `FormData` class in the test file:

```javascript
// Mock the server action
jest.mock('../lib/actions', () => ({
  shareMealHandler: jest.fn(),
}));

// Mock the FormData class
global.FormData = class {
  get() {
    return '';
  }
};
```

## Result

After implementing these changes, the test now passes successfully:

```
 PASS  __tests__/share.test.tsx
  MealsSharePage
    √ renders the heading with correct text (58 ms)
    √ renders the form with all required fields (26 ms)
    √ renders the ImagePicker component (7 ms)
```

## Recommendations for Future Testing

1. Consider adding these polyfills and mocks to a central testing utility file to make them available to all tests
2. When testing components that use browser-specific APIs, always check if those APIs are available in the test environment and provide polyfills if necessary
3. For server components, consider creating more comprehensive mocks to avoid issues with server-side APIs
