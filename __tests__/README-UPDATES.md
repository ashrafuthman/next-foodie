# Testing Updates

## New Tests Added

### 1. MealShareFormSubmitButton Component Test
- Created a test for the MealShareFormSubmitButton component
- Tests both the default state (not pending) and the pending state
- Mocks the useFormStatus hook from react-dom to control the pending state

### 2. Actions Library Test
- Created a test for the shareMealHandler function in the actions.ts file
- Tests that the function correctly processes form data and calls the necessary dependencies
- Tests handling of both complete and missing form data
- Mocks the saveMeal, revalidatePath, and redirect functions

## Testing Approach

The tests follow the existing testing patterns in the project:
- Using Jest as the test runner
- Using React Testing Library for rendering and interacting with components
- Mocking dependencies to isolate the code being tested
- Testing both happy paths and edge cases

## Recommendations for Future Testing

1. **Fix the share.test.tsx issue**: The test is failing with "ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined". This could be fixed by adding a polyfill for TextEncoder in the Jest setup file.

2. **Add more edge case tests**: The current tests cover the basic functionality, but more edge cases could be tested, such as:
   - For MealShareFormSubmitButton: Testing with different button text or styles
   - For shareMealHandler: Testing with invalid form data or error handling

3. **Add integration tests**: The current tests are unit tests that test components and functions in isolation. Integration tests that test how components work together would provide additional confidence in the application.

4. **Add end-to-end tests**: End-to-end tests that simulate user interactions with the application would provide even more confidence in the application's functionality.

5. **Improve test coverage**: Use Jest's coverage reporting to identify areas of the code that are not well-tested and add tests for those areas.

## Conclusion

The new tests provide additional confidence in the application's functionality by testing previously untested components and functions. They follow the existing testing patterns in the project and should be easy to maintain and extend in the future.
